# Santa Pelada

**A (WIP) website to help friends to schedule and organize sports matches.**

You know that feeling when you're using such bad software, to the point that you find yourself
thinking:

>Damn, I didn't even know that it was possible to write such shitty code.

This is a project to prove myself that I can write a much better website than [Peladeiro].
Or at least one that works.
